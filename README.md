This project is a web-based Simon game inspired by "The Simpsons," where players must remember and replicate a sequence of colors. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features interactive buttons that animate and play sounds when clicked. The game starts with a keypress, advancing through increasing levels of difficulty. If the player makes a mistake, a game-over message appears, prompting a restart. Overall, it combines engaging gameplay with colorful visuals and sound effects, capturing the spirit of the classic memory challenge.
